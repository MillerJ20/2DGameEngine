# 2DGameEngine

This is a simple learning experience that will (hopefully) blossom into an engine I will develop my next game in. 

So far, I have learned that I hate Modern C++ syntax (boy oh boy smart pointers are ugly, but **useful**)
I have also learned about data-driven design and leveraging the Entity-Component-System architecture for an engine. How fun!
